# Implementation-of-Parallel-String-Matching-Algorithms-with-CUDA
Implement parallel string matching algorithms with CUDA in C

## TO DO LIST
### Cuda Naive Implementation

- [x] Binary tree witness array elimination
- [x] Brute force after elimination
- [ ] modulized with testing
### Improve system
- [x] share memory; consecutive memory access
- [ ] parallel construction of witness array
- [x] block level synch
- [ ] periodic case
