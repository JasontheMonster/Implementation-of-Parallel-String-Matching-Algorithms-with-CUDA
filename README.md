# Implementation-of-Parallel-String-Matching-Algorithms-with-CUDA
Implement parallel string matching algorithms with CUDA in C

## TO DO LIST
### Cuda Naive Implementation

- [x] Binary tree witness array elimination
- [x] Brute force after elimination
- [] KMP
- [] modulized with testing
### Improve system
- [] share memory; consecutive memory access
- [] parallel construction of witness array
- [] block level synch
- [] periodic case
#### Share memory; Parallel construction of witness array; better finishing string matching; 

### Non-peirodic case
